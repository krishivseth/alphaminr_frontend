                <p>Has Jerome Powell lost his nerve in the face of Trump's trade war? President Donald Trump has pushed for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates by "a full point" to juice the economy as inflation hovers near target, but Fed Chair Powell and his colleagues want to gauge the economic fallout from tariffs before making any moves. The stakes couldn't be higher as inflation was tame in May but economists expect Trump's tariff policy to raise consumer prices noticeably heading into summer .</p>
        <p>The plot thickens as Trump announced new tariffs on 14 countries to go into effect August 1, including significant levies on Bangladesh, Cambodia, Japan, South Korea and others. The duties are similar to, and in some cases higher than, his April "reciprocal" tariffs, with Japan facing a 25% levy . Markets are processing the implications while Fed officials remain reluctant to move, fearful that tariffs could cause inflation in the coming months. "Everyone that I know is forecasting a meaningful increase in inflation in coming months from tariffs because someone has to pay for the tariffs," Powell stated .</p>
        <p>Adding to the complexity, economists warn that "the tariff tax hike, restrictive monetary policy and worries about a further intensification of the trade war are weighing heavily on labor demand." Private payrolls excluding healthcare and education rose by just 23,000, well below the 50,000 average pace in the previous 12 months - a sign that seasonal adjustments may be masking underlying weakness .</p>
